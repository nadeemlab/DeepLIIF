## Installation

Please use the conda environment file.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate statistics_env
```

## Usage

To compute the segmentation/classification scores between two datasets, where images of each dataset are contained in an individual folder:
```
python ComputeStatisctics.py --gt_path path/to/ground-truth-masks 
                             --model_path path/to/masks-generated-by-model
                             --output_path path/to/output
```

Arguments:
- Required
  - gt_path: path to ground-truth masks
  - model_path: path to masks generated by the model
  - output_path: path to save output csv files
  - mode: mode of the statistics computation including Segmentation (for computing segmentation accuracy metrics), ImageSynthesis (for computing realistic image synthesis metrics), All (for computing segmentation and image synthesis metrics)
  - raw_segmentation: use this argument if the segmentation mask needs refinement
  - image_types: types of images
